# Human Storytelling Guidelines

The HSG seeks to derive story design principles from the neuroscience corpus. Inspired by [Apple's Human Interace Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview).

## Brain Basics

Brains didn't evolve to think.

Brains predict, not react.

Brains use concepts to model the world

Emotions are constructed

Variation is the norm

## Fundamentals

1. The audience is an active user, not a passive viewer. They bring their priors, predictions, and affect to your content.
2. Storytellers are experience engineers. We scaffold user's brains with priors about the world 
3. Your story may be someone's reality. Do sharks often attack humans? Should I pee on a jellyfish sting? Do all Chinese know kungfu? If a user has no other experience, your story is their only frame of reference. 
4. Stories are consequential. Religioius stories inspire the lives of billions.
5. Frozen inspires children to dress & act like Elsa. The Godfather inspired mobsters to behave more honorably. James Bond inspires the dress & behavior of young men.
6. Stories are consequential. Jaws inspires people to be afraid of sharks. The Dark Knight inspires Joker wannabes and copycat crimes. Taxi Driver inspired John Hinckley Jr. to attempt to assassinate Ronald Regan. Films that normalize boys stalking girls as romantic.


## Duty of Care

Storytellers scaffold people's reality. With this great power comes great responsibility, legally called [duty of care.]().

Civilization is a fragile, interdependent edifice of professionals who provide & protect non-professionals.

“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.”
Mark Twain


1. Realistic depictions 
2. Realistic consequences of actions
3. Dispel stereotypes, not enforce
4. Responsible craftsmanship. Shelley Duvall by Stanely Kubrick bat scene took 127 takes. “Going through day after day of excruciating work was almost unbearable,” said Duvall to Rolling Stone in 1980. “Jack Nicholson’s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And in my character, I had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week.” Filming the movie had extended way overtime, and because of this, Duvall was separated from her family for a whole year.
