# Human Storytelling Guidelines

The HSG seeks to derive story design principles from the neuroscience corpus. Inspired by [Apple's Human Interace Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview).

## Brain Basics

Brains didn't evolve to think.

Brains predict, not react.

Brains use concepts to model the world

Emotions are constructed

Variation is the norm

## Logical Consequences

1. The audience is an active user, not a passive viewer. They bring their priors, predictions, and affect to your content.
2. Storytellers are experience engineers. We scaffold user's brains with priors about the world 
3. Your story may be someone's reality. Do sharks often attack humans? Should I pee on a jellyfish sting? Do all Chinese know kungfu? If a user has no other experience, your story is their only frame of reference. 
4. Stories are consequential. Religioius stories inspire the lives of billions.
5. Frozen inspires children to dress & act like Elsa. The Godfather inspired mobsters to behave more honorably. James Bond inspires the dress & behavior of young men.
6. Stories are consequential. Jaws inspires people to be afraid of sharks. The Dark Knight inspires Joker wannabes and copycat crimes. Taxi Driver inspired John Hinckley Jr. to attempt to assassinate Ronald Regan. Films that normalize boys stalking girls as romantic.
