Multipolar World is Just. 
When I was growing up in the United States, and when you listen to media, there is constant use of the phrase "leadership." US leadership in the world. Why? Who decided the US should be the leader? Was there a vote? Or did was it self-declared? Who wants you? A world of equals doesn't have a leader, it has a council. A discussion. 

In the US, the government is supposed to REPRESENT people. REPRESENT your views and fight for your ideas. 
In China, the government is supposed to TAKE CARE of everyone. To improve everyone's life, so they are free from hunger, free from violence, free from homelessness, free from disease. There are many many different views and ideas, but these ideas are not the priority. Life is the priority. Ideas are meaningless if everyone's dead. 

# Cultural Differences

| Concept        | U.S.          | China |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| Authority           | Distrust. Perhaps a thematic remantic of its Fight for Independence from England, Americans don't trust their government. Feature of the society. Echos in popular culture, where the establishment is evil and requires a vigilante rebel to save it (Star Wars, Batman, Avengers, Spiderman) | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `ore`      | hmm   |
| ok           | good `route` drop | yum  |




## What China needs to know about the US

1. Distrust of authority. Perhaps a thematic remantic of its Fight for Independence from England, Americans don't trust their government. Feature of the society. Echos in popular culture, where the establishment is evil and requires a vigilante rebel to save it (Star Wars, Batman, Avengers, Spiderman)
2. The US government cannot and is not allowed to control its media. This means US government policy is re-interpreted by companies and influencers.
3. The American standard for the word "friend" is low compared to Chinese. A person you met randomly on the train and talked to for a 5 minutes can be considered a friend. 
4. Positively valenced, highly energetic. If someone asks you "how've you been" and you've been neutral, you respond with "good." If you're good, you respond with "Amazing" or "awesome." 
5. No expectation of competence. Because the government is currently tasked with minimal responsibility for people's well-being, plus decades of corruption and inefficiency, there is no expectation of competence from the government. Becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because of these expectations.
6. Charitable. because there is no expectation of competence from government, Americans are more charitable towards strangers in need. Randomly surprise people with money. Paying for random person's medical debt. People pull together because they don't have an expectation of competence. 
7. Higher emphasis on likeability. A common thought about a Presidential candidate from an average voter is "Someone I could have a beer with." This is bizarre to some. Would you rather your surgeon be competent, or cool to hang out with? Your electrician to be skilled, or social? Because US elections are beauty pageants, likeability can overshadow capability.
8. Casual brutality. Everything is a joke. Lisa F Barrett summarizes nicely. Check her notes on reality TV, sitcoms, and now entertainews. 
9. Race-colored glasses. With a barbaric history of enslaving people, with a random choice of epidermis melanin concentration as an indicator. 150 years? after emancipation proclamation and legal banning of slavery, institutionalized discrimination is yet to be fully addressed. Countries like South Africa and Canada strive to have Truth & Reconciliation. US is far away from this.
10. Crusader fetish. Everyone wants to be a hero, but some Americans feel their everyday actions are changing the world. Not wearing a mask and yelling at a business. Picketing outside someone's home. Every moment is of historical importance. A mindset that comes from "every vote counts" and "anyone can be the President" and "the US is the greatest country in the world.
11. Lack of modesty. Greatest country. Proud of not knowing other languages or understanding other cultures. Don't even know they are just a measly 4% of the world population. Can't even name other countries on a map. 
12. Evangelical. It's not enough to be right. You have to CONVERT other people to think exactly like you, to do exactly what YOU do, do it exactly how YOU do it. 
13. Veneered diversity. Since so much genetic diversity and physical phenotypes, there is an ongoing fight for representation. But what may be unknown to many is how this is for Americans. This doesn't represent other people of other countries. Some Americans will claim to be "German" without any understanding of German history or culture, don't even mention German language. 

Speed Dating. Americans tend to quickly signal their "identity." Progressive vs Conservative, Republican vs Democrat. Many other cultures tend to take things slower. Related to low standards for "friendship."


## What the China thinks of

Table

It's so condescending to hear people say: "oh, China or Japan or some 'Eastern culture' has an education system that doesn't let students challenge authority or create innovation." What? Have you met people from these countries? Where were the most advanced electronics manufactured? How about entrepreneurs? How about some of the top scientists and innovators in the US, or the UK or France?
