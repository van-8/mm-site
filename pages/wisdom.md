## Memorable Quotes

### Nelson Mandela (Madiba)
*    Courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace.
*    “May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.”
*    “Remember to celebrate milestones as you prepare for the road ahead.”
*    “Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.”
*    A Nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.
*    No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love.

Always sit in a circle.
Be the last to speak. Give everyone the chance to be heard, to contribute.

### Isaac Asimov
*    It is change, continuing change, inevitable change, that is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be. This, in turn, means that our statesmen, our businessmen, our every man must take on a science fictional way of thinking.

### Vigdís Finnbogadóttir

### Jenson Huang
"Vision matters. But I like the word **perspective** because it makes it possible for anyone to have one. You see the world differently than someone else." [Jenson Huang](https://youtu.be/Xn1EsFe7snQ?t=359) founder nVidia

### John Danaher
