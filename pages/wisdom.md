Courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace. Nelson Mandela
“May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.”
“Your playing small does not serve the world. Who are you not to be great?”
“Remember to celebrate milestones as you prepare for the road ahead.”
“Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.”
“A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.”
“A Nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.”

“No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love.”

“In Africa there is a concept known as ‘ubuntu’ – the profound sense that we are human only through the humanity of others; that if we are to accomplish anything in this world it will in equal measure be due to the work and achievement of others.”

Always sit in a circle.
Be the last to speak. Give everyone the chance to be heard, to contribute.

"Vision matters. But I like the word **perspective** because it makes it possible for anyone to have one. You see the world differently than someone else." [Jenson Huang](https://youtu.be/Xn1EsFe7snQ?t=359) founder nVidia
