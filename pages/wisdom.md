## Memorable Quotes

### John F Kennedy
"Let us examine our attitude toward peace itself. Too many of us think it is impossible. Too many think it unreal. But that is a dangerous, defeatist belief. It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable, that mankind is doomed, that we are gripped by forces we cannot control.

"We need not accept that view. Our problems are man-made — therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings. Man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable — and we believe they can do it again."  
<br/> 

["Peace Speech 1963"](https://youtu.be/0fkKnfk4k40?t=365)

<details><summary>Attainable Peace</summary><blockquote>
  Let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable peace-- based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions--on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interest of all concerned. There is no single, simple key to this peace--no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or two powers. Genuine peace must be the product of many nations, the sum of many acts. It must be dynamic, not static, changing to meet the challenge of each new generation. For peace is a process--a way of solving problems.  
  <br/>
  With such a peace, there will still be quarrels and conflicting interests, as there are within families and nations. World peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor--it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to a just and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us that enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not last forever. However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem, the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relations between nations and neighbors.  
  <br/>
  So let us persevere. Peace need not be impracticable, and war need not be inevitable. By defining our goal more clearly, by making it seem more manageable and less remote, we can help all peoples to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move irresistibly toward it.

### Nelson Mandela (Madiba)
*    Courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace.
*    “May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.”
*    “Remember to celebrate milestones as you prepare for the road ahead.”
*    “Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.”
*    A Nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.
*    No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love.

Always sit in a circle.
Be the last to speak. Give everyone the chance to be heard, to contribute.

### Isaac Asimov
*    It is change, continuing change, inevitable change, that is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be. This, in turn, means that our statesmen, our businessmen, our every man must take on a science fictional way of thinking.

### Vigdís Finnbogadóttir
I would never offend my host by making preferences. Neither would I offend my countrymen by saying 'What is the best place I have ever visited in the country.' Wherever there is hospitality, warmth, and politeness, well you remember that for the quality of it."

### Jenson Huang
"Vision matters. But I like the word **perspective** because it makes it possible for anyone to have one. You see the world differently than someone else." [Jenson Huang](https://youtu.be/Xn1EsFe7snQ?t=359) founder nVidia
