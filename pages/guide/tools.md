Transform this knowledge into methods of weaving memorable stories.

(users)=
## Users
Watching and listening are not passive actions. Just as with an app or a device, a person brings their {term}`priors`, predictions, and affect to the story. Deprecate the terms "audience" and "viewer." 

    quoteable code block

**Intend**

The brain does not have "circuits" or "parts" for sadness or happiness. There is nothing to "turn on" or "activate." So we can only *intend* to nudge towards a certain affective state, conceptual memory, or other prior.


**Perceive***

Brain states cannot be recognized, they can only be perceived. {ref}`users` guess at each others brain state.

**Nudge**


(priors)=
## Priors
The expectations and past experiences a person brings to a certain situation. For example: languages they understand, familiarity with a situation, cultural expectations, etc. Priors feed into predictions. The term comes from Bayesian statistical inference.

Prior listing specifies the audience.

Tropes are familiar priors. 

Metaphors.

Global priors are being created.


Prediction Errors 


Priming


(affectplex)=
## Affectplex

The affective circumplex. Where do we intend it to shift.

These are features to be measured.

A landscape instead of a fuzzy point?

**Energy**
Called arousal.

Chemicals in the blood. 

Neutral. 

High energy.

Low Energy.

**Valence**

Neutral.

Positive valence.

Negative valence. 


(meatspace)=
## Meatspace

Manipulating meatspace

Location. Where is it being watched? At a theatre? Home cozy on the couch or bed? On the bus or subway to work? Amusement park?

Why do we cry?

Frission.

(music)=
## Music


(expression)=
## Facial & Body Expressions

Not a language. Faces don't equal emotions. There is body language, but people speak different languages. Variation is the norm. 


(colors)=
## Colors

Don't intrinsically have any emotion. 

Cultural assocations, priors. 

(comparison)=
## Comparisons & Dynamic Range

Comparing input with priors. Errors. 

**Distance**
If Thousand Brains is correct about physical model creation, are mental models also mapped out? Far apart or close together? 

**Scale**

**Light**


(landmarks)=
## Landmarks

How are they created? landmark cells. grid cells? boundary cells?


## Experential Blindness

Flexing on people who don't know.
Using other languages.
Using vocabulary. Showing Dunning-Kruger?


## Emotional Possibility Space


### Possibilities. 
Affective possibility space. What are all possible input to the brain?

### Impossibilities.
### Granularity.



## Conceptual Combination

Beware false dichotomies. Do you poop or do you pee? Do you 


## Industry Specific

Cartoons.

Documentaries.

Linear Stories. Film, TV, Audio.

Interactive Stories. Games, Experiences. In-person.


## Cultural Variation


Authentic doesn't exist. 

Key and Peele episode with the gangster.
